# What is schoco? {üç´}

SCHOCO stands for **SCH**ool **O**nline **CO**ding.

The project is heavily inspired by [codeboard.io](https://codeboard.io) ([github](https://github.com/codeboardio)). Since codeboard didn't receive any more updates since end of 2015 and as we need slightly other features, we now try to create a similar web-based IDE which fits to our needs for **learning (Java)-Programming explicitly at School**!

It is mainly developed to enable coding-homeworks for pupils what has failed so far in reality for two reasons:
 1. Installation of the cumbersome JRE and IDEs
 2. Saving and sharing the solutions via Mail/USB/Messenger??? WTF!?
---

## Planned main-features
- No registration methods for pupils. Only teachers can register pupils who will always be part of a class or course.
- Pupils see coding-homeworks when logging in and they can code, compile, run and commit their homework completely online without the need of an offline installation of the JRE or any other software.
- JUnit for automatic testing of the commited homework
- Teachers can open pupils solutions with a single click and show/compare them at the beamer in the classroom without sending directories or files.
- Explicitly no possibility to open foreign projects based on a project-id or similar (other than codeboard!). That's first because of privacy-reasons and second to minimize copying from others.
- Use gitea on backend for storing all code.
- Compilation and running the programms completely on the server.
