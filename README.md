# What is schoco? {üç´}

SCHOCO stands for <ins>**SCH**</ins>ool <ins>**O**</ins>nline <ins>**CO**</ins>ding.

Schoco is a web-based IDE for Java-Programming (Java 8) with a focus on learning programming at school. It's designed to be used by pupils and teachers in the classroom and at home. 

Until now, it has hardly been possible to assign **programming homework** because the installation of the software at home may be difficult or cannot be presupposed and the submission and control of the results is cumbersome.

Therefore the **core feature** of schoco is the possibility to create **coding-homework** for students, which can even be tested automatically by JUnit-Tests. The tool works completely online without the need of an offline installation of the JRE or any other software by any user.

Schoco is definitely not intended to be used for professional software-development.

The project is heavily inspired by [codeboard.io](https://codeboard.io) ([github](https://github.com/codeboardio)). Since codeboard didn't receive any more updates since end of 2015 and as we need slightly other features, I did create this similar web-based IDE which fits to our needs for **learning (Java)-Programming explicitly at School**!

You wanna know more about schoco? Then I recommend to read the [main-features](#main-features), read the [FAQ](#faq) and take a look into the wiki (YET TO COME).


## Main-features

- Web-based IDE for Java-Programming (Java 8), which is fully functional to Java <ins>except</ins> UIs (obviously), writing files to disk, accessing the internet and a few others. The restrictions are needed for security reasons and are provided by Java's security manager.
- Each user can create private projects and teachers can convert their projects into homework, which are then editable by the pupils of the selected course.
- Pupils directly see coding-homework when logging in and they can code, compile, run and test their homework completely online without the need of an offline installation of the JRE or any other software.
- JUnit for automatic testing of the homework - the newest test-result (percent of how many JUnit-Tests passed successfully) of pupils is directly visible to the teacher.
- Teachers can open pupils solutions with a single click and show/compare them at the beamer in the classroom without the necessity of sending directories or files.
- After a configurable start-date, pupils can see the solution of the teacher and compare it with their own solution.
- Pupils can only open their own project or homework - no possibility to open the homework-solution of your best buddy. That's first because of privacy-reasons and second to minimize copying from others.


# Installation

Installation requires a few more steps than your average docker-service, but it's still pretty straight-forward, and only requires a few minutes.

  1. You need `docker` and `docker-compose` installed.
  2. I recommend to create a separate user for running schoco. Why? Because nproc is used to limit the number of running processes to prevent fork-bombs (soft-limit=3700, hard-limit=5000). If you don't create a separate user, the nproc-limit will be applied to all processes of your user, which might affect any other running software.
  3. Make sure, that your normal user (not root / sudo) is member of the docker-group! If you created a separate user for schoco (previous step) than this rule applies to this user!
  4. Create the data-forder `data` where you want to store the DB and temporary code. This step must be done BEFORE starting up the docker containers.
     
     ‚ùó <ins>YOU</ins> (or the user from step 2) must be the owner of this folder - not root (don't use sudo). ‚ùó 
  5. Prepare your Web-Server / Reverse-Proxy to forward requests to schoco. It requires special care for the websocket-connection to work! Here are two example configurations for Apache2 and NGINX (both assuming, that schoco is running on port 1234):
     - NGINX
      ```nginx
      location /containers {
          proxy_pass http://localhost:1234;
          proxy_http_version 1.1;
          proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
          proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
          proxy_set_header Host $host;
      }

      location / {
          proxy_pass http://localhost:1234;
      }
      ```

     - Apache2  
      ```apache
      RewriteEngine on
      RewriteCond ${HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
      RewriteCond ${HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]
      RewriteRule .* "ws://localhost:1234/$1" [P,L]

      ProxyPreserveHost On
      ProxyRequests off
      AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode
      ProxyPass /containers ws://localhost:1234/containers
      ProxyPassReverse /containers ws://localhost:1234/containers
      ProxyPass / http://localhost:1234/ nocanon
      ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:1234/
      ```

  6. Adapt the following `docker-compose.yml` to your needs and run `docker compose up -d`:
  
```yaml
version: "3"

networks:
  schoco:
    name: schoco

services:
  schoco-backend:
    image: phitux/schoco-backend:<tag> 
    # use the latest tag, see https://hub.docker.com/r/phitux/schoco-backend/tags
    container_name: schoco-backend
    restart: always
    user: "1000:1000" 
    # find out your user-id (uid) and group-id (gid) with 'id' in your bash. Must be the same user as the owner of the data-folder!
    group_add:
      - ${DOCKER_GROUP_ID} 
      # run in your bash: export DOCKER_GROUP_ID=$(getent group docker | cut -d: -f3)
    environment:
      - FULL_DATA_PATH=/path/to/my/data 
      # same as (left part of) first volume - but here as FULL PATH!!!

      - MAX_CONTAINERS=4 
      # sets the amount of java-workers

      - SECRET_KEY=secret 
      # used for session token - run 'openssl rand -base64 32' to generate a random key. Changing it and restarting the backend will log out all users!

      - TEACHER_KEY=teacherkey 
      # this is the 'password' that is used to create new teacher-accounts. It must only be known to the teachers.

      - GITEA_USERNAME=schoco 
      # this is the username of the gitea-user (see last image in this yaml-file) 

      - GITEA_PASSWORD=schoco1234 
      # and that is the password of the gitea-user. 
      # Actually both username and password can stay like this, if you use the gitea-image from this yaml-file and if gitea is not made public (default)!

      - GITEA_HOST=http://schoco-gitea:3000
      # stays like this, if you use the gitea-image from this yaml-file and if gitea is not made public (default)!
      # change it to your domain, if you use a public gitea-instance
    networks:
      - schoco
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock

  schoco-frontend:
    image: phitux/schoco-frontend:<tag> # use the latest tag, see https://hub.docker.com/r/phitux/schoco-frontend/tags
    container_name: schoco-frontend
    restart: always
    group_add:
      - ${DOCKER_GROUP_ID} # run in your bash: export DOCKER_GROUP_ID=$(getent group docker | cut -d: -f3)
    networks:
      - schoco
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    ports:
      - "80:8080" # adapt the left host-port to your needs

  schoco-gitea:
    image: gitea/gitea:1.17.3 # you could probably use a newer version, but API-changes might break something...
    container_name: schoco-gitea
    restart: always
    environment:
      - USER_UID=1000
      - USER_GID=1000
      - GITEA__security__INSTALL_LOCK=true
    networks:
      - schoco
    volumes:
      - ./gitea-data:/data
      - /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro

```
  7. **On the first startup** you will need to add the gitea user using the following command
  > `docker exec --user 1000 schoco-gitea gitea admin user create --admin --username schoco --password schoco1234 --email schoco@example.com`


# Architecture
<img src="./schoco_architecture.svg">

## How it works under the hood
- The logical Core is the API, which is build with [Python Fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). The frontend is build with [Vite 4](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/).
- The API is communicating with [Gitea](https://gitea.io/), SQLite and the workers [schoco-cookies](./cookies/)
- The 'cookies' in 'schoco-cookies' stands for <ins>**Co**</ins>mpile <ins>**o**</ins>nline, <ins>**k**</ins>eep <ins>**i**</ins>ts <ins>**e**</ins>xecution <ins>**s**</ins>upervised. Since it's part of schoco it's of course called 'schoco-cookies' üç™ü§≠. They are docker-containers, that are running parallely at a configurable amount. They are doing the actual 'work' with the Java-code and are used for compiling, executing and testing all the code. Each container is only used for a single action and is then replaced by a new one. This is done for security-reasons, so that no code of a user can be executed in the same container as the code of other users. 
- Gitea (a git repo, by default running as separate docker-container) is used to store the code. Each project has an own repository with an UUID as name, which is also visible in the browser-URL when opening a project. When editing a homework as pupil, each pupil gets it's own branch.
- SQLite (a single-file DB) is used to store everything that is NOT code, like the users, courses, and meta-information about projects and homework.
- Nginx is included as mandatory gateway. Since the websocket-connection (to view the live-output of the code) connects to the Docker Socket (Docker-API), this whould be a major security issue. Therefore, the websocket-connection is proxied by Nginx, which only allows websocket-connections to Docker.

## FAQ

- What happens after a homework deadline has passed? 
> At the moment the pupils can continue using schoco just as before (edit, save, run, test,...). At [progress](#progress) you can see, that there might be coming a button within the next months to see previous version of students' solutions, e.g. before deadline.
- Can I code everything that's normally possible in Java? 
> No, the 'Java security manager' restricts several things like accessing the internet, writing files to the disk or executing commands. Beside that, UIs are obviously not possible and there is also a limited code-execution-time (set to 10s for pupils' private projects, homework can have a higher limit).
- A teacher can change passwords of other teachers. Is this intended?
> Yes! Since there is no mail-service included to send a password-reset-link, you need another possibility to login as teacher in case you lost your password. Since schoco will probably always be hosted individually for each educational institution, there is hopefully no hostility between colleagues.
- Code execution and testing is quite fast, how does it come?
> Each action get's executed by an individual docker container. The trick is, that these containers are already created and running in the background, waiting for a job. The code is then just written to the folder which is mounted to the container and the job inside the container is started via a very reduced Java-API.
- Can I use schoco for other programming languages than Java?
> No, not at the moment. Since we don't need it for the german school-curriculum, it won't be implemented in the near future. But supporting multiple languages should not be too dificult. Feel free to fork and contribute üòâ
- It works with git underneath - so can I use git-features and git-commands?
> No! It uses git under the hood, since this design-decision makes sense when handling a lot of code. Schoco uses several git-features like branches and the commit-history, but there is no direct access to git by the user.
- Can I run/install/develop schoco without docker?
> No, absolutely not! It requires docker to run the 'schoco-cookies' (the Java-workers) - it's an intended security-feature.
- Live-output of the Java-programs is provided by websocket. What happens if a firewall doesn't allow websocket?
> Schoco will automatically switch to http-response (no live-output), if websocket-connection fails and back to WS when it's working again. Sadly there's only a single http-response, when the whole Java-program finished executing, therefore no live-output. Additionally right now, there's no way to send user-input to a running program, when websocket is not working. If this is a major issue for you, then please open an issue on github - perhaps there's a way to find a solution.
- Why does schoco consist of four different docker images?
> The <ins>backend</ins> (schoco-backend) is written in Python FastAPI. To make this thing fast, the docker image is based on [tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi](https://github.com/tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi-docker) which includes auto-tuning for the number of workers. Otherwise you would have to regulate the number of workers via more complex systems like kubernetes - but I want to keep things as simple as possible. Schoco is designed for educational institutions with a moderate number of simultaneous users.  
The <ins>frontend</ins> ("schoco-frontend" - which is delivered by nginx), is then unfortunately not compatible with the special multi-process image of the backend. Therefore, the frontend runs in a separate docker image.  
The <ins>git-repo</ins> (gitea) is naturally running in it's own original and untouched docker image.  
Last but not least, the <ins>Java-workers</ins> (schoco-cookies) are single-use containers!


## Progress

**There a few more features missing that might be implemented within the next months:**
- [ ] "way-back-button": use underlaying git-struture to view any state of a file when it was previously saved
- [ ] Mark projects as templates (when being a teacher)
- [ ] Perhaps some possibility to view pupil's private projects as teacher?!

# Changelog
I use [semver](https://semver.org/) for versioning! I <ins>strongly</ins> recommend to create a backup of your data-folder before updating schoco! Better save than sorry...

````

## 1.0.0
(2023-10-06)  
````
Initial release üåü
````


# Start developing

On the linux-host both following packages need to be installed: `libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev`

## 1) Gitea
You have to use Gitea as git-repo, since schoco uses the gitea-API.

### Option A: *Localhost*
Install gitea using the docker-compose.yml file from this repo. You can choose to set gitea public available via browser, but actually that's not necessary and you can skip reverse-proxying gitea -> it's enough to have it only available at localhost.

If you used the docker-compose.yml from this repo, then you'll need to do a second step **only once for installation**. Run the following command to create the git-user (use a better password!):
`docker exec --user 1000 gitea gitea admin user create --admin --username schoco --password schoco1234 --email schoco@example.com`

### Option B: *External instance (public available)*

Host your gitea-instance anywhere (secured by TLS!!) and connect to it. This will lead to a speed drop caused by increased latency, since every file sadly needs a separate API-call.

## 2) Frontend (Vite 4 + Vue 3)
`cd frontend` 

Initial Installation: `npm install`

On every start: `npm run dev`

## 3) Backend (Fastapi)

`cd fastapi`

Initial Installation (Python 3.10 and pip required): `pip install -r requirements.txt`

On every start: `export FULL_DATA_PATH=/full/path/to/data_folder MAX_CONTAINERS=2 SECRET_KEY=secret TEACHER_KEY=teacherkey GITEA_LOCALHOST_PORT=3000 GITEA_USERNAME=schoco GITEA_PASSWORD=schoco1234 PRODUCTION=False && python -m uvicorn main:app --log-level debug --reload`

If your gitea-instance is NOT running on localhost, then exchange `GITEA_LOCALHOST_PORT` with `GITEA_HOST=https://git.mydomain.tld`

## 4) Backend (nginx)
For Websocket-communication, there must always be running nginx (even during development).  
> `docker run -d -p 80:8080 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /path/to/repo/nginx/nginx.dev.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf --name nginx --group-add $(getent group docker | cut -d: -f3) nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:1.23-alpine`


## 5) Backend ('Cookies' for compilation/execution)

Considering nproc, the separate schoco-user might get interesting!?

Otherwise not necessary (neither during developing nor production): 
- Prepare System by creating a new user:group 'schoco:schoco' with ids '1234:1234', which is used to run the containers! `sudo groupadd --gid 1234 schoco` and  `sudo useradd --uid 1234 --gid 1234 -m -d /home/schoco schoco`


# Build and run schoco locally

1. Build fastapi image: `cd fastapi && docker build -t phitux/schoco-backend:latest .`
2. Compile the cookies API: `cd cookies/api && javac Java_api.java`
3. Build cookies worker image: `cd cookies && docker build -t phitux/schoco-cookies .`
4. Build frontend image: `docker build -t phitux/schoco-nginx:latest .`
5. Create docker network for schoco: `docker network create schoco` 
6. Set the `DOCKER_GROUP_ID` env variable: `export DOCKER_GROUP_ID=$(getent group docker | cut -d: -f3)`
7. Make sure you have a `data/` directory in the repo root. This is where the sqlite db and all temporary code is stored. This may not be owned by root!
8. Start schoco with `docker compose up -d`
9. Schoco is available under [http://localhost](http://localhost)

> **On the first startup** you will need to add the gitea user using the following command
> `docker exec --user 1000 schoco-gitea gitea admin user create --admin --username schoco --password schoco1234 --email schoco@example.com`
